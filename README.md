**CLanguage** is a .NET Standard library that contains a C/C++ parser, a compiler (to its own VM),
and an interpreter (for its VM). It's a very small library that enables you to embed C/C++ scripts into your .NET apps.

It is used to simulate Arduinos in the app [iCircuit](http://icircuitapp.com).
It features cycle counting so that infinite loops and long computations can be paused.

I have describe other details of it in my blog entry [Oops, I Wrote a C++ Compiler](https://praeclarum.org/2018/08/27/oops-i-wrote-a-c-compiler.html).
